********************************************************************************

The code in this repository is released with a variant of the MIT license.
The code is derived from the explanations in the book *Designing Audio Objects
for Max/MSP and Pd* by Eric Lyon.

There are a few items that are not covered under the MIT license. The external
moogvcf~ is based on the Csound unit generator "moogvcf." Since Csound is
released under the GNU LGPL, I have also released the code for the Max/MSP
and Pd ports of "moogvcf" under the LGPL for consistency.

This repository contains a folder called \_SDK\_ which has copies of both the
Max/MSP SDK and Pd source code. Both have their own license terms and have
been copied below for reference.

All other code, Xcode projects, Max/MSP and Pd patches are released under the
following license:
