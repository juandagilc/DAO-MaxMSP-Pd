### The code in this repository is released with a variant of the MIT license.
The source code is derived from the explanations in the book *Designing Audio
Objects for Max/MSP and Pd* by Eric Lyon.

There are a few items that are not covered under the MIT license.

1. The external moogvcf~ is based on the Csound unit generator "moogvcf." Since
Csound is released under the GNU LGPL, I have also released the code for the
Max/MSP and Pd ports of "moogvcf" under the LGPL, for consistency. See details
[here](moogvcf~/Source/license.txt).

2. This repository contains a folder called \_SDK\_ on which references to the
Max/MSP SDK and Pd source code repositories are added as git submodules. Both
repositories have their own license terms and the links to the full text have
been copied below.

The rest of the source code, Xcode and Visual Studio projects, Makefiles,
Max/MSP and Pd patches, and compiled objects are released under the following
license:
